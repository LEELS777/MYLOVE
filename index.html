                    <p>My Dearest Jeev,</p>
                    <p>I came for an interview in 2023, but I found you. That day, I prayed to God - please let me get this job, not for the work, but because I wanted to see you daily. And God listened.</p>
                    <p>I had big dreams and goals. I was focused on my career. But then you came into my life, and suddenly nothing mattered without you. I realized that real success means having you by my side.</p>
                    <p>I never gave this much attention to anyone before. But with you, even this feels small. You deserve so much more, but I promise to give you everything I have.</p>
                    <p class="letter-signature">Forever yours,<br>Your Love</p>
